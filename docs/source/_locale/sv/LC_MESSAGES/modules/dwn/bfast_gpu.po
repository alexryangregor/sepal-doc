"Large amounts of satellite data are now becoming available, which, in "
"combination with appropriate change detection methods, offer the "
"opportunity to derive accurate information on timing and location of "
"disturbances (e.g. deforestation events across the Earth's surface). "
"Typical scenarios require the analysis of billions of image "
"patches/pixels, which can become very expensive from a computational "
"point of view. The `BFAST package <https://pypi.org/project/bfast/>`_ "
"provides efficient, massively parallel implementation for one of the "
"state-of-the-art change detection methods called `Breaks For Additive "
