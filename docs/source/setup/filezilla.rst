.. warning::

FTP solution 
------------

SEPAL content can also be accessed via SSH File Transfer Protocol (FTP). any FTP solution might work but in this section we will present it using FileZilla. Adaptation to your favorite FTP solution should be straight forward. 

FileZilla
^^^^^^^^^

If you don't have any FTP solution installed on your local machine AND if you don't know what is a FTP solution no worries, this documentation page is here to help you. 

.. seealso::

    An FTP client is software that allows you to connect to an FTP server in order to exchange files Once connected, you can publish your files so that they are accessible from your website.

FileZilla®, is a free FTP solution. The FileZilla Client not only supports FTP, but also FTP over TLS (FTPS) and SFTP (this is the one we are actually using in SEPAL). It is an open source software distributed free of charge under the terms of the `GNU General Public License <https://www.gnu.org/licenses/gpl-3.0.en.html>`_.

.. tip:: 

    The software can be downloaded from `here <https://FileZilla-project.org/download.php?type=client>`_

Now that the presentation are done, let's move on to the usage

Connect your FTP client to SEPAL
^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^

Accessing files in SEPAL is easy using FileZilla. To use FileZilla, open the application and connect to the SEPAL server by selecting Menu :code:`File -> Site Manager` in the menu tab. 

In the site manager pop-up click on the :code:`New Site` button. Use the screenshot below as a guide for filling in the form:

-   **Host:** ssh.sepal.io 
-   **Port:** 443
-   **Protocol:** SFTP – SSH File Transfer Protocol
-   **Logon Type:** Normal 
-   **User:** <your SEPAL username>
-   **Password:** <your SEPAL password> 

.. tip::

    for :code:`user` and :code:`password`; use the credential you use to connect to the platform

Click on :code:`Connect` and your SEPAL drive will appear in the right panel. In parallel, in the left panel, you'll find the files and folders of your computer.

Use the FTP client to interact with SEPAL 
^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^

The next step is to get familiar with FileZilla's window layout.

Here is a quick introduction: 
Below the toolbar (1) and quick connect bar (2), the message log (3) displays transfer and connection related messages. Below, you can find the file listings. The left column (local pane, 4) displays the local files and directories, i.e. the stuff on the PC you're using FileZilla on. The right column (server pane, 5) displays the files and directories on the server you are connected to. Both columns have a directory tree at the top and a detailed listing of the currently selected directory's contents at the bottom. You can easily navigate either of the trees and lists by clicking around like in any other file manager. At the bottom of the window, the transfer queue (6) lists the to-be-transferred and already transferred files.
