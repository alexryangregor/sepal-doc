Workflows
=========

Overview
--------

SEPAL is gathering numerous tools and recipes to help users perform data analysis. These tools can be combined in a modular way to execute more complex workflows. 

This section is presenting some workflows that involve the usage of multiple SEPAL tools (modules and/or recipes). 

.. note:: 

    If your workflow is not described here and you think it would make sense to have it in the main SEPAL documentation, please send us a message in our `GitHub issue tracker <https://github.com/openforis/sepal-doc/issues/new/choose>`__.
