CCDC Slice
==========

Introduction
------------

As those parameters are stored at pixel-level we retain the possibility to extract each pixel's modelled reflectance at any given point in time for the time-span of the underlying time-series. In addition, we can access the parameters describing the model of the temporally intersecting segment. Those can be used in the feature space of subsequent classification and generally improve class separability. This step is called slicing and is further described in the `**CCDC slice recipe** <../cookbook/ccdc_slice.html>`__).
